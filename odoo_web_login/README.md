# Installation #
Installation process is at present stage only possible in manual way.

## Prerequisite ##
Before installing the module make sure that the you have configured an addon path for custom addons. In a Linux system the parameter in the config file usually looks similar as the following example:
 specify additional addons paths (separated by commas)
addons_path = /opt/odoo/odoo-server/addons, /opt/odoo/custom/addons
In this case you have to install the modules into /opt/odoo/custom/addons. At the present stage on dependency could not automatically resolved so you have to install one extra module that vertical community depends on.<br><br>

Then go to you odoo webinterface to the module section and start "Update module list". Then look for the "Odoo Web Login Screen" in Apps (module list) and install.
I hope you enjoy checking out what all you can do with this application.
